Yet another config file.

It has minimalism and functionality.
The theme is somewhat automatic based on your background.
However, you do need swww for your wallpaper "manager", and imv.
With IMV if you run "imv -r /path/to/wallpapers" you can hit the w key on a wallpaper you like and it will autoset the wallpaper and theme for you.
Highly recommend having pywalfox on firefox to auto theme it too.

There are some other stuff in there like waybar theming you can play around and add more stuff, I like mine simple and functional.
